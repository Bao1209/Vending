The program first obtains the six coin denominations from the user. Then, it further obtains the 
amount of money inserted into the vending machine, and the price of the buying item. You can 
assume that (a) all user inputs will always be positive integers, (b) the coin denominations are always 
entered in strictly decreasing order, and (c) the money inserted is always no smaller than the buying 
item price. You can use int variables to store the inputs. Use the strategy described above to 
determine the number of coins of each denomination to be returned and print out the result.
However, if no coin combinations can be found, print out just the change amount and then the
message â€œCannot find combination!"
